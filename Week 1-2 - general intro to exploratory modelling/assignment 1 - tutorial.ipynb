    "\n",
    "Let's connect this simple model to the workbench. We make the following assumptions\n",
    "1. $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are uncertain. We assume that $\\beta$ is somewhere between 0.05 and 0.3, while $\\gamma$ is somewhere between 0.01, and 0.15.\n",
    "2. The outcomes of interest are $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$ over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect the model to the workbench, we need to do at least 3 things:\n",
    "1. **Instantiate a model class**; the workbench comes with a variety of model classes for making it easy to connect with existing simulation packages such as Vensim, PySD, Simio, or Netlogo. Since we have a model implemented in Python, we can use the most basic Model class.\n",
    "2. **Specify the uncertain parameters** (and/or decision levers); Note below how the name of the parameters matched the name of the keyword arguments of the SIR_model function. The workbench makes a distinction between RealParameters, IntegerParameters, BinaryParameters, and CategoricalParameters. For this example, our parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ have a continuous range so we use RealParameters \n",
    "3. **Specify the outcomes of interest**; the workbench makes a distinction between TimeSeriesOutcomes and ScalarOutcomes. $S$, $I$, and $R$ are time series, so we use TimeSeriesOutcomes"

The workbench by default will use a latin hypercupe sampler to generate points in the parameter space defined by the uncertainties and/or levers. The uncertainties jointly span the uncertainty space. The levers (not used in this example) span the lever space. A point in uncertainty space is a scenario. A point in lever space is a policy. The combination of a scenario and a policy (where either might be None) is an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few remarks on this\n",
    "1. The workbench assumes uniform distributions. During the class it will be explained in more detail why we make this assumption and what consequences follow from this.\n",
    "2. The workbench comes with a wide range of alternative samplers, some of which we will use later in the course\n",
    "3. The workbench offers support for taking advantage of the fact that many modern computers have multiple cores. See assingment 2 for this week for more on this. For now, we use a SequentialEvaluator\n",

This is intuitive, since a slow outbreak has more time to spread, and a fast outbreak has less time to spread."
